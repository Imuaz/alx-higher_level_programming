# 0x00. Python - Hello, World:ocean:

**INTRODUCTION**

The project covers various aspects of Python programming, including its awesomeness and the creator of the programming language, Guido van Rossum. Additionally, it explains the origin of the name 'Python' and the philosophy behind the Zen of Python.

Furthermore, the project delves into the practical application of Python, providing a detailed understanding of how to use the Python interpreter, how to print text and variables using the print function, and how to use strings. It also covers indexing and slicing in Python, which is useful for manipulating strings.

In addition, the project explains the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `~~pycodestyle`. By the end of this project, It is expected to have a comprehensive understanding of Python programming, from its fundamentals to its practical applications and best practices.

## Requirements:pushpin:

**Python Scripts**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A [README.md](../README.md) file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A mandatory [README.md](./README.md) file, at the root of the folder of this project.
- The code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files is tested using `wc`

**Shell Scripts**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l` file should print `2`)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All files must be executable

**C Scripts**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- The code should use the `Betty style`. It must be checked using `betty-style.pl` `and betty-doc.pl`
- the use of global variables is not Allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
