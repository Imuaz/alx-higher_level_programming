# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions :loop:

**INTRODUCTION**

The project covered a wide range of topics related to Python programming. It started with an explanation of why Python programming is awesome, followed by an explanation of the importance of indentation in Python. The project also covered how to use various control flow statements, such as `if`, `if...else`, `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses on loops, as well as how to use comments to document code.

Furthermore, the project explained how to assign values to variables, use `while` and `for` loops, and how Python’s `for` loop differs from `C`'s. It also covered the use of the `pass` statement and `range` function, as well as an understanding of what a function is and how to use it. The project also explored the scope of variables and what a traceback is.

Lastly, the project covered the arithmetic operators in Python and how to use them.
